            <p>
              I am a software developer with an eye for details. My previous
              experience as a baker has taught me how to appreciate every
              component that goes into making a masterpiece â€” and how to do that
              while working collaboratively with others in fast-paced,
              deadline-driven environments. Coder by day and baker by night, I
              am excited to contribute my skills in team management, designing,
              and coding with my adaptability, creativity, and people skills to
              help companies solve problems and achieve their goals.
